Inside this folder, all kinds of scripts are being put which are used for development so far ;)

# lumin_file_readout

This script can be used to read out the raw logged data from our arducam_node_launch

This script is therefore optimized to detect and output whether there is a luminescence signal or not

# other scripts

The other scripts basically show how to read out a gyro or ultrasonic sesnor with a RaspberryPi. TakePic and stepper show how to take a pic on a RaspberryPi / how to simply take a picture!!!
